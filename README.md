## Credit
First I want to thank [Vandad Nahavandipoor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPvVD8t02U8), from whom I got to learn a lot about Flutter development and many concepts of development in general. He has made an amazing video explaining all the aspects from setting up the Flutter environment to deploying your app on the Play Store and App Store

## Getting Started

To run this project you first need to set up **VS Code, Andriod Studio, Android SDK,** and **Flutter** on your computer/laptop.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

After Setup, Download this project and use the flutter run command. (Make sure you have a mobile device connected with USB Debugging turned On)

So make sure to run the APK(to directly run on mobile devices) and review the code, and give me some feedback 😊.
